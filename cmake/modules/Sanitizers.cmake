# Sanitizers catch what the type system and the warnings cannot: use-after-free,
# undefined behaviour, data races. They are off by default because they slow the
# build and the binary down; nightly-sanitizer.yml turns them on.
#
# Usage:
#   include(Sanitizers)
#   cppbp_set_sanitizers(mylib PRIVATE)
#
# A sanitized library is not a drop-in replacement for an unsanitized one:
# anything that links it has to be built the same way, or the sanitizer runtime
# calls compiled into it resolve to nothing. cppbp_sanitizer_flags() exists so
# that a test which builds a separate consumer can ask what those flags were.

# Declared here rather than in each project's CMakeLists.txt, because this module
# is what reads them. An option nobody declares still works from the command
# line, but it is absent from `cmake -LAH` and from ccmake, so the only way to
# find out it exists is to read the source.
